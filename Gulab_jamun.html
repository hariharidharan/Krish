		<li>6 green cardamom pods, seeds removed</li>
		<li>1 tsp caster sugar</li>
		<li>100g full-cream milk powder</li>
		<li>40g plain flour</li>
		<li>½ tsp baking powder</li>
		<li>50g ghee or softened unsalted butter plus 1kg ghee, for frying</li>

		<li>4-5 tbsp whole milk</li>

	<h2>Preparation</h2>

    <ol>
    	<li>To make the syrup, gently heat the cardamom, sugar and 500ml water in a saucepan. Don't let the water boil before the sugar has dissolved.</li>
    	<li>Simmer for 10 mins, then cool.</li>
    	<li>Gradually add the rosewater, saffron and a little of its soaking liquid until you have a subtly flavoured syrup. Set aside.</li>
    	<li>To make the gulab jamun, use a pestle and mortar to grind together the cardamom and sugar until fine.</li>
    	<li>Sieve the milk powder, flour and baking powder into a mixing bowl and stir in the cardamom and sugar mixture. </li>
    	<li>Rub in the 50g ghee or butter using your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
    	<li>Add the yogurt, lemon juice and enough milk to form a soft dough, taking care not to overwork the mixture.</li>
		<li>Oil your hands with a little sunflower oil and shape small portions of the dough into walnut-sized balls, about 3cm in diameter and 20g each. <br>Make sure the dumplings are smooth and have no cracks or folds.</li>
    	<li>Reheat the syrup until it comes to the boil, then turn off the heat and cover with a lid.</li>
    	<li>Heat the 1kg ghee in a wok or karahi to 130C or until a small piece of dough dropped in turns golden in 40 seconds.</li>
    	<li>Fry the balls, in batches, over a medium heat for 5-7 mins, moving them around until they are an even, deep brown. </li>
    	<li>Remove from the saucepan using a slotted spoon, then drain on kitchen paper. Add to the warm syrup, leaving them to soak for 2-3 hrs or <br>preferably overnight.</li>
    	<li>When ready to eat, warm the gulab jamun through in a wide saucepan, spooning over the syrup. Serve piping hot with the pistachios scattered over</li>
    </ol>
