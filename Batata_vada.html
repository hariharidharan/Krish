	<h2>Preparation</h2>

    <ol>
    	<h3>Filling</h3>
    	<li>Peel the skin of potatoes, cut them into cubes and wash them.</li>
    	<li>Cook the potatoes in any way desired but make sure they are just firm and not mushy. I have just sprinkled water, covered with lid and microwaved <br>the potatoes for 5 minutes.</li>
    	<li>Alternatively, you can cook potato cubes in boiling water for 15 to 20 minutes or pressure cook it for 2 whistles or cook even in steamer or pot.</li>
    	<li>In a small pan, heat oil on medium to low flame. Add mustard seeds, and when they start to splutter add urad dal, garlic cloves <br>(skip if you are preparing on vrat days) and hing and sauté till the raw smell of garlic goes off (about 1 minute) and urad dal becomes light in color.. <br>Next add turmeric powder, curry leaves and saute for another few seconds.</li>
    	<li>Mash the cooked potatoes. To this add green chilies, ginger, coriander leaves, salt and sautéed ingredients prepared above and mix well.</li>
    	<li>Divide this into 9 or 10 portions or to desired size bonda or vada and make balls out of it.</li>

    	<h3>Batter</h3>
    	<li>In a bowl, add chickpea flour, red chilli powder, cumin seeds, turmeric powder, asafoetida, salt, and mix</li>
		<li> Add water little by little and whisk to form a batter that is thinner than pancake batter. See that there are no lumps and batter is not too thick or too thin.</li>
    	<li>The amount of water I added was approximately ⅓ cup but not more than ½ cup. This also varies based on brand of flour, weather conditions and water.</li>
    	<li>Your vadas should be coated easily in this batter. If the batter is too thick then add water, and if it becomes too watery then add chickpea flour and adjust <br>accordingly.</li>

    	<h3>Fry vada</h3>
    	<li>Heat oil in a heavy bottomed pan for frying.</li>
    	<li>Once the oil is hot, dip each potato ball in the batter and drop it in oil. Add 4 to 5 balls depending on the size of your pan. Deep fry them <br>till they are golden brown in color</li>
    	<li>Transfer this to paper towel to absorb any excess oil.</li>
    	<li>Repeat the process for remaining potato balls.</li>
    	<li>Batata Vadas or Aloo Bonda are now ready.</li>
    </ol>
